Every year, a large number of people are killed and injured in motor vehicle collisions, which raise serious concerns about public safety. In order to find trends and forecast collision occurrences, this study will use a variety of machine learning approaches to examine motor vehicle collision data from the USA. Comprehensive crash data, including time, location, and contributing factors, is included in the dataset used for this investigation. We hope to increase predicted accuracy and offer insights that help guide traffic safety measures by utilizing algorithms like Decision Trees, Random Forests, Adaboost, and gradient boost.
